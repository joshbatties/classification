# MNIST Classification Project
This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning classifiers to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 

## Overview

The MNIST Classification Project aims to provide a comprehensive example of how to preprocess data, train different machine learning models, evaluate their performance, and visualize the results. 
The models used include:
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier
- Dummy Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier
